# Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (1.2.1+)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (8.8.0+)
- [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) (0.12+)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Originally made against a 9.6)

# How to debug/deploy locally

- Clone the git code
- Setup a database in PostgreSQL
- Add a new __local.js__ file in the __/config folder__ with following:
```javascript
module.exports = {
   environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
   connections: {
     postgres: {
       adapter: 'sails-postgresql',
       host: 'Your Hostname',
       port: 1234,
       user: 'Your username for the database',
       password: 'Your password for the username',
       database: 'Your database name'
     }
   },  
   facebook: {
     clientID: 'ID of the facebook app',
     clientSecret: 'secret of the facebook app'
   }
}
```
- Open command prompt and navigate to the cloned folder
- Execute `yarn install` (Will install all packages mentioned in packages.config
- Execute `sails lift` (Will deploy the application and run it on port 1337 by default - use `--port 1234` to change)

# How to contribute

- Do not commit/push directly on master, this branch is tied to a heroku, this should remain stable at all times. So work with a seperate branch, and commit all you want there, then create pull request and approve that one yourself or if you are unsure, ask one of the other collaborators.
- Squash merge of the pull request is allowed, to keep the history a bit cleaner
- Please write proper and good commit messages ([Guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages))
- local.js will always be ignored, the DB connection is injected through heroku, so no need to worry about the DB connection
- Use spaces, not tabs, 2 spaces = 1 tab
- Please do check the 'Issues' tab in github, to make sure noone else is working on it. And if yo uare working on something, assign yourself to it.

If anything forementioned needs revision, we will listen.
